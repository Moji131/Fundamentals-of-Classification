title: "Setup - CPU"
---

This lesson is designed for Software Carpentry users who have completed [Plotting and Programming in Python] and want to jump straight into image classification. We recognize this jump is quite large and have done our best to provide the content and code to perform these types of analyses.

It uses the Anaconda package manager to install the required python packages, including the Spyder IDE. 

These instructions are for setting up tensorflow in a **CPU** only environment.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
Please note this lesson is designed to work with CPU only environments. This was an intentional decision to avoid the difficulties in setting up GPU environments. If you are an advanced user and choose to set up a GPU environment, you are on your own. We will not be able to troubleshoot any issues with GPU set up on the day of the workshop.

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
## Install Python Using Anaconda

[Python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and a frequent choice for machine learning as well. Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the installer [Anaconda] which includes most (but not all) of the software you need. Make sure you install the latest Python version 3.xx.

Also, please set up your python environment **at least** a day in advance of the workshop. If you encounter problems with the installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution
### Windows

Check out the [Windows - Video tutorial] or:

1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution] with your web browser.

2. Download the Python 3.xx installer for Windows.

3. Double-click the executable and install Python 3 using _MOST_ of the default settings. The only exception is to check the **Make Anaconda the default Python** option.
