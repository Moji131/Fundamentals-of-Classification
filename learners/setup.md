title: "Setup - CPU"
---

This lesson is designed for Software Carpentry users who have completed [Plotting and Programming in Python] and want to jump straight into image classification. We recognize this jump is quite large and have done our best to provide the content and code to perform these types of analyses.

It uses the Anaconda package manager to install the required python packages, including the Spyder IDE. 

These instructions are for setting up tensorflow in a **CPU** only environment.
