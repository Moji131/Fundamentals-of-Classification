## Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field that involves creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes everything from recognizing speech and images to making decisions and translating languages. Within AI, Machine Learning (ML) is a subset focused on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning (DL), a further subset of ML, utilizes neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in large amounts of data. This technique has led to significant advances in various fields, such as image and speech recognition.

Since the 1950s, the idea of AI has captured the imagination of many, often depicted in science fiction as machines with human-like or even superior intelligence. While recent advancements in AI and ML have been remarkable, we are currently capable of achieving human-like intelligence only in specific areas. The goal of creating a general-purpose AI, one that can perform any intellectual task a human can, remains a long-term challenge.
