## What is Classification?

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict categorical class labels. Given input data, a classification model attempts to assign it to one of several predefined classes.

Some examples include:
- Email spam detection (spam vs. not spam)
- Disease diagnosis (positive vs. negative)
- Image recognition (cat, dog, or other)

## Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Understand common classification algorithms
- Apply them using Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- Evaluate and optimise models
- Handle imbalanced datasets

## Topics Covered

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Neural Networks (MLPClassifier)
4. Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
5. Dealing with Imbalanced Data
6. Optimisation and Tuning

## Required Libraries

We will use the following Python libraries throughout the workshop:
- `NumPy` – numerical operations
- `Pandas` – data manipulation
- `Scikit-Learn` – machine learning models and tools
- `Matplotlib` – data visualisation

## Setup Instructions

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
